   - Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis financial is a big financial institution that handles all kinds of financial transactions for  their clients. The company was concerned with their security for their clients transactions. This is a big concern for everyone as their is a lot of inforation being constantly passed around that many people wouldn't want others to access.
     
  -  What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When we found security vulnearabilites, we immediately changed the code to help prevent any attempted unauthorized access and then updated all of the plugins and dependencies. Then we rechecked everything with the maven dependecy checker. Overall software security can help a companys overall well being, by keeping bad actors out of files they shouldn't have access to. This allows the company to not have to worry about the overall application security. It is important to code securely, because thats where the security begins, without a good foundation, it only builds up to a house of cards.
    
  -  Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Overall, the velnerability assessment was helpful, in showing the many different threats that can exist in a seemingly simple application.
    
  -  How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    used SHA-256 encryption to make sure the programs stayed as secure as possible  when transmiting the data. I would continue  to use tools like Maven in order to determine credible vulneabilites in the future, which gives insight in updating tools to protect the data.     
  -  How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
We made certain the code and software application were functional and secure, by testing the overall functionality of our code, by having it display certain information when accessed. After refactoring the code,  we recreated a new Maven dependency checker to make sure that their was no new vulnerabilites being added.
    
  -  What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Many different tools, and resources were helpful in this course, and will be when dealing with future problems. Knowing what type of questions to look up will help in the overall problem solving I will do in the future, which is a skill that this class helped refine.
    
  -  Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them the entirety of this assignment in order to showcase my ability to be able to determine vulnerabilities in this project.
